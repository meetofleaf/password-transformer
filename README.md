# Fire Password Generator 2018

This code generates a "Fire Password" by modifying the user's input password using a set of predefined rules. The modified password is then concatenated with a randomly generated number to create the final password.

## Usage

To generate a Fire Password, simply run the `fire_password.py` script and follow the instructions on the command line. The script prompts the user to enter a password and then applies substitutions to the password.

The script then appends a randomly generated number between 0 and 1000 to the modified password to create the final Fire Password.

## Example

```
$ python fire_password.py

Fire Password
_____________

Password: MyPassword123
M\/P@$$\/\/0RD123_42
```

## Contributions

This project is open to contributions. If you have any ideas for improving the password generation process or enhancing the functionality of the script, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue in the repository.
